# AI Notes for RSIGCI Project

## PROMPT FORMAT: READ THIS BEFORE EVERY CHANGE

### TO DOs
- Always read this file before making any code or content changes.
- Match hero and section styles across all pages for visual consistency.
- Add breadcrumb navigation at the top of main pages unless told otherwise.
- Keep the About page hero section logo-free unless the user specifically requests a logo.
- Use content-based modal sizing by default; only use fixed modal size if the user asks for it.
- Bold all occurrences of 'REIGN-NAN' and the full company name in milestone modals and key sections.
- Update this file with new instructions or preferences as soon as the user gives them.

### NOT TO DOs
- Do NOT add the company logo to the About page hero unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Do NOT use a fixed modal size unless the user requests it.
- Do NOT change the background style of the milestone modal unless the user asks for it.
- Do NOT remove or alter the milestone section unless the user requests it.
- Do NOT make visual changes to the hero section without matching the products page style if the user asks for consistency.

*You (the AI) must check and follow these instructions before every edit. Update this file as the user's requirements change.* 

## Reference: hero standard
- The hero section should match the style, structure, and layout of the hero section in products.html.
- This includes: blue gradient background, background image overlay, min-height, padding, centered headline, subtitle, and description, and no logo unless specifically requested.
- Breadcrumb active/current page text should be blue (text-blue-600 font-medium).

## Reference: header standard
- The header should include the company logo on the left, navigation links (About Us, Products, Services, Careers, Contact Us) centered or spaced, and a hamburger menu for mobile.
- Navigation links should use consistent font, spacing, and color (gray by default, blue on hover for active/hovered links).
- The header should have a white or transparent background, with a subtle shadow or border if needed for separation.
- The header height and padding should match the current main pages (64px min-height, appropriate responsive padding).
- The header should be visually and structurally consistent across all main pages.
